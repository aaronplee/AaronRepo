- add debian/ubuntu package spec

- split out topgen-scrape.sh (or implement sub-commands); these are
  all potentially very long running operations (e.g., scraping may
  take weeks), so unexpected things may happen, and resuming manually
  should be possible without too much overhead:
	- scraping
	- certificate generation
	- vhost IP address resolution

- can we configure topgen-loopback service to shut down when last service
  depending on it goes away ?

- SELinux policy for sbin scripts (right now calling chcon explicitly)

- augment Web and DNS data with (simulated) WHOIS functionality
